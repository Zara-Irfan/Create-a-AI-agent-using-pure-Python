# AI News Agent

The AI News Agent is a smart and interactive assistant built with Python.
It automatically fetches live, real-time news headlines from Google News based on the topic you mention — without needing any sign-ups, API keys, or complex setup.

You can talk to it naturally, just like you would with a person.
For example, you can say things like:

“Show me the latest art news”

“Change topic to cybersecurity”

“Exit now, thank you”

and it will understand what you mean.

# What It Does

Brings you live global news directly in your terminal

Understands natural language commands

Supports any topic (technology, sports, AI, politics, etc.)

Works instantly — no configuration or accounts required

# How It Feels

When you start the program, it greets you as your personal AI assistant.
You can type in any sentence that mentions a topic or the word news, and it instantly shows you the latest real headlines related to that subject.

It feels simple, smart, and interactive — like chatting with your own digital journalist.

 Example Conversation

You: “Can you show me some news about space?”
AI: “Fetching latest ‘Space’ news…”
AI: “NASA announces new lunar exploration plans”
“SpaceX prepares next-generation rockets for 2026 missions”

You: “Change the topic to sports”
AI: “Fetching latest ‘Sports’ news…”

You: “Okay, exit now”
AI: “Goodbye! Stay informed and stay curious.”

 No Setup Needed

The AI News Agent is designed to be simple.
Once you open it, everything works automatically — it connects to Google News and displays live headlines right in your terminal.

You don’t have to sign up for anything, get any API key, or configure any settings.
